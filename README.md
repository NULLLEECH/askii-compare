# aval files

This is a simple peice of code that finds the contents of one file in another.

[command] FILE-1 FILE-2

There are no options

This was a simple coding project that I made as to prove a point.
It comes with a basic example.

This was initally ment for askii art, but can work for any string in the first file.

To compile;
make all

To compile debug look into the makefile.

NOTE: This code wasn't designed for large scale compares.

this has no dependent code else than the C libary.
